# Noisemakers
This repository contains all of the code we used to create the various projects for Noisemakers! Tracing the Origins of Modern Music in Italy, including our Max MSP patches and C++ Arduino code.

The Basic Max patch can be placed in a folder with an audio file. That file will then need to be added and named in the patch's buffer object (upper left) and the name will need to be added to the groove object at the bottom of the patch.
